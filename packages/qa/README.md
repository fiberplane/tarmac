# @tarmac/qa

Prose-first QA scenarios for apps scaffolded from this repo.

This package intentionally contains no runner, fixtures, source code, or assertion library. A QA
scenario is a markdown file with small YAML frontmatter, readable steps, and prose references to the
template or code it exercises. Humans can run the scenarios manually, and agents can follow them by
reading the same prose.

The `_template.md` and `_example-*.md` files are not baseline tests. They are copyable examples for
new projects. Delete or rewrite them when a consumer adds real product scenarios.

## Layout

```
packages/qa/
  scenarios/   Markdown scenario files
  helpers/     Reusable markdown procedures referenced by scenarios
  results/     Local run notes, screenshots, logs, and captures; gitignored
```

Files under `scenarios/` and `helpers/` that start with `_` are examples or templates. Keep real
scenario and helper filenames unprefixed, for example `create-project.md` or `login-flow.md`.

## Frontmatter

Every scenario starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: Create a project
requires:
  - bun
depends-on:
  - setup-test-dir
tags:
  - cli
---
```

Fields:

| Field        | Required | Meaning                                                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | yes      | Human-readable scenario name                                              |
| `requires`   | no       | Tools, services, env vars, or credentials needed before the scenario runs |
| `depends-on` | no       | Prerequisite helper names that must run before the scenario               |
| `tags`       | no       | Filtering labels such as `cli`, `api`, `worker`, or `browser`             |

Do not add a `drift-anchors` field. Drift bindings live in `drift.lock`; plain prose references do
not create bindings. Relative markdown links may still be checked for existence, but only explicit
lockfile bindings are freshness-checked.

## Scenario Format

Use the same heading structure for every scenario:

1. `## Goals` states the behavior under test.
2. `## Prerequisites` lists setup, running services, and helper dependencies.
3. `## Steps` contains numbered steps. Each step has `Action`, `Expected`, and `Verify`.
4. `## Cleanup` returns the workspace and external systems to their original state.

Steps should be specific enough for an agent to execute without inventing product behavior. Prefer
observable checks over implementation guesses.

## Drift References

When a scenario depends on a template, source file, or doc section, mention that target in prose and
bind it explicitly with `drift link <scenario> <target>`. For example:

```markdown
The CLI structure comes from docs/templates/cli.md.
```

After adding or changing scenarios, refresh the lockfile and verify:

```bash
drift link packages/qa/scenarios/<scenario>.md <target-path>
drift check
```

Targetless `drift link <doc>` refreshes bindings that already exist in `drift.lock`; it does not
discover new prose references. If a linked template or source file changes later, `drift check`
flags the scenario for review.

## Helpers

Helpers are markdown procedures, not executable scripts. A helper should include:

- Purpose
- Inputs
- Steps
- Outputs
- Cleanup or rollback notes

Copy `helpers/_template.md` to a new filename without the `_` prefix to start a new helper.
Reference prerequisite helpers in `depends-on` by their filename without the `.md` extension.
Reference cleanup helpers from the scenario's `## Cleanup` section. Keep reusable setup and cleanup
in helpers so scenarios stay focused on product behavior.

## Results

Write local run output under `packages/qa/results/`. Useful artifacts include:

- Run notes and timestamps
- Screenshots or recordings
- HTTP transcripts
- CLI stdout and stderr captures
- Cleanup notes

Everything in `results/` is gitignored except `.gitkeep`.

## Driving UIs From Scenarios

Browser scenarios should instruct the runner to use the available `agent-browser` skill instead of
introducing per-scenario browser tooling. For a web app, name the URL to open and the visible state
to verify. For an already-running Electron app with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled, include the
CDP port, for example `agent-browser connect 9222`. If a consuming environment has an
Electron-specific skill, that skill can wrap the same CDP-driven flow.

## Running Scenarios

There is no package script yet. To run a scenario:

1. Read its frontmatter and prerequisites.
2. Run any helpers listed in `depends-on`.
3. Execute each step in order.
4. Save local evidence in `results/`.
5. Run cleanup.

When a future runner or QA agent is added, it should preserve this authoring surface.
